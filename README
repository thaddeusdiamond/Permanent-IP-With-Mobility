Permanent IP Identifiers using Rendezvous Servers

About This Project
==================
This project seeks to demonstrate an alternative to Mobile IP that does not
require triangular routing, yet allows reliable, efficient communication
between highly mobile peers.  This allows both peers to communicate end-to-end
but still be able to move at the same exact time without losing contact.

The basic mechanism we have provided uses a fixed rendezvous server to provide
push-based updates to all "subscribers" when a mobile node's IP changes.  When
any mobile node receives an update, it modifies the socket that is currently
communicating with the node to send to a new IP, preventing packet loss.

Directory Structure
===================
src       - All source code for development branch
ext       - External libraries required to run tests
doc       - All documentation generated by doxygen
doc/html  - [Not in main git branch] Automatically generated HTML from doxygen
bin       - [Generated by Makefile]  All executables created by project
obj       - [Generated by Makefile]  All object files (.o) created by project
logs      - [Generated by Makefile]  Structured directory for tests and
            executables to write out to

Testing
=======
This project uses the Google Unit Testing (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
framework for all tests.  These tests are housed in the src/Tests directory
and can be run from within the src directory using either:
   $ make Test                  # Makes all tests

or:
   $ make [DirectoryName]Test   # Makes only tests for a specific directory
