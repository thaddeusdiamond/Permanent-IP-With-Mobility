Permanent IP Identifiers using Rendezvous Servers

External Libraries
==================
In order to compile the external libraries associated with the project, please
run:
    $ ./install-ext


Compilation
===========
To compile the source, please run:
    $ make -C src


Running the Demo
================
Three directories will be created: bin/, obj/ and logs/. In addition, three
deployment scripts will be copied to the root directory.  These scripts can only
be run from the Yale CS Zoo.  To run the demo, first type:
    $ ./Server.Kill

To ensure no existing servers remain active. Then, to deploy the DNS and simple
rendezvous server, run:
    $ ./Server.Deploy

This will begin the servers.  Finally, run:
    $ ./App.Deploy [Message] (python|tick) (^First Choice)

Currently the demo only supports communication between nodes named python
and tick (because of how the DNS is configured).  Run this on two nodes, and
let argument one be the "from" and argument two be the "to".  This should be
inverted at the different nodes.  Also, ensure that the message being
transmitted by each node is distinct, otherwise errors will occur.
